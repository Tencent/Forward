## Forward

Forward is a library for high performance deep learning inference on NVIDIA GPUs. It provides a well-designed scheme that directly parse Tensorflow/PyTorch/Keras models to high-performance engine based on [TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt). Compared to TensorRT, it is easy-to-use and easy-to-expand. So far, Forward supports not only mainstream deep learning models in CV, NLP and  Recommend fields, but also some advanced models such as BERT, GAN, FaceSwap, StyleTransfer.

## Features

- Utilize TensorRT API and customized operators for high-performance deep learning inference.
- Support not only mainstream deep learning models in CV, NLP and  Recommend fields, but also advanced models such as BERT, GAN, FaceSwap, StyleTransfer.
- Support FLOAT/HALF/INT8 infer modes.
- Easy to use: Load directly Tensorflow(.pb)/PyTorch(.pth)/Keras(.h5) models and then do inference with TensorRT.
- Easy to expand: Register customized layers refer to [add_support_op.md](doc/en/usages/add_support_op.md).
- Provide C++ and Python interfaces.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- NVIDIA CUDA >= 10.0, CuDNN >= 7 (Recommended version: CUDA 10.2 )
- TensorRT >= 7.0.0.11,  (Recommended version: TensorRT-7.2.1.6)
- CMake >= 3.12.2
- GCC >= 5.4.0, ld >= 2.26.1
- (Pytorch) pytorch >= 1.7.0
- (Tensorflow) TensorFlow >= 1.15.0 (download [Tensorflow 1.15.0](https://github.com/neargye-forks/tensorflow/releases) and unzip it to `source/third_party/tensorflow/lib`)
- (Keras) HDF 5 (Built from `source/third_party/hdf5` as default)

### Build with CMake

Generate Makefiles or VS project (Windows) and build. Forward can be built for different framework, such as Fwd-Torch, Fwd-Python-Torch, Fwd-Tf, Fwd-Python-Tf, Fwd-Keras, Fwd-Python-Keras, refer to [CMake Build](doc/en/usages/cmake_build.md).

#### CMake build arguments

- `TensorRT_ROOT` [Required]: Path to the TensorRT installation directory containing libraries
- More CMake options refer to [CMake Options](doc/en/usages/cmake_build.md)

#### Logging

Forward use [easylogging++](https://github.com/amrayn/easyloggingpp) for logging, and use `forward_log.conf` as the log configuration file. 

- If `forward_log.conf` can be found in the workspace, then Forward use this log configuration. (Refer to [Using-configuration-file](https://github.com/amrayn/easyloggingpp#using-configuration-file)).
> forward_log.conf
```
* GLOBAL:
   FORMAT               =  "[%level] %datetime %fbase(%line): %msg"
   FILENAME             =  "Forward.log"
   ENABLED              =  true
   TO_FILE              =  true
   TO_STANDARD_OUTPUT   =  true
   PERFORMANCE_TRACKING =  true
   MAX_LOG_FILE_SIZE    =  2097152 ## 2MB - Comment starts with two hashes (##)
   LOG_FLUSH_THRESHOLD  =  100 ## Flush after every 100 logs
```
- If `forward_log.conf` cannot be found in the workspace, then Forward use the default log configuration, which write logs into `logs/myeasylog.log`.

### Unit Test

When the project is built, unit_test can be used to verify the project is successfully built.

```bash
cd build/bin
./unit_test --gtest_filter=TestTfNodes.*
```

### Use Forward-Cpp

Refer to [Demo for using Forward-Cpp in Linux](demo/fwd_cpp/ReadMe.md)

### Use Forward-Python

Refer to [Demo for using Forward-Python](demo/fwd_py/ReadMe.md)

### Use Forward-Bert

Refer to [Demo for using Forward-Bert](demo/bert/README.md)
